In addition, this module includes the development of speci\\ue054 c competencies in healthcare for mothers and children. It is thus, intended to serve as a refresher module, building on existing knowledge and the development of new skills in the area of maternal and child health. ASHAs that are newly recruited into the programme, could directly start with Module 5, 6 and 7. This module is also designed to serve as a reading material for ASHAs, and is therefore, to be given to each ASHA. A companion communication kit for the ASHA to use when she conducts home visits and village meetings has also been developed. There is also a manual for trainers with training aids to use during the training of ASHA. The training plan envisages a total of 20 to 24 days of residential training, to impart the skills that these two modules are teaching.  AcknowledgementsThe sections on maternal and newborn care are excerpted from the SEARCH Manual on ‘How to Train ASHA in Home-Based Newborn Care’ and SEARCH developed ASHA Reading Material on Home-Based Newborn Care. Thanks are due to Members of the National ASHA Mentoring Group, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India (BPNI), the Public Health Resource Network (PHRN), and the training,  maternal and child health and malaria divisions of the ministry for providing extensive feedback, and also HLFPPT for providing information on NischayKit. The Integrated Management of Neonatal Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI) package is also incorporated into these modules. PART ABeing an ASHAPart ABeing an ASHA\\n7\\nBeing an ASHA1. Role of ASHAASHA is considered to be a healthcare facilitator and provider of a limited range of healthcare services. Health rights would be integral to her work and would be focused in the areas of community mobilisation to improve health status, access to services, and promote people’s participation in health programmes. \\nPART A\\nDidi, which day is the ANM coming to our village?Didi, they are charging me at the govt hospital and I don’t have the money to pay – can you help me?\\nThis is the first day of diarrhoea. Do I have go to the far away town or is there something you can suggest?\\nObjectives of this SessionBy the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about:• The role of an ASHA and the activities expected of her.• The health outcomes that her work should result in.• The sets of skills that she needs to be e\\ue000 ective in.• The records that she has to maintain.• The arrangements for her support and supervision.\\nASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n8\\n2. Activities of an ASHA ASHA’s work consists mainly of \\ue054 ve activities:1. Home Visits: For two to three hours every day, for at least four or \\ue054 ve days a week, the ASHA should visit the families living in her allo\\ue001 ed area. Home visits should \\ntake place at least once in a month if not more. Home visits are mainly for health promotion and preventive care. Over time, families will come to her when there is a problem and she would not have to go so o\\ue002 en to their houses. Meeting them anywhere in the community/village is enough. However, where there is a child below two years of age or any malnourished child or a pregnant woman, she should visit the families at home for counselling them. Also, if there is a newborn in the house, a series of \\ue054 ve visits or more becomes essential.  2. A\\ue000 ending the Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND): On one day every month, when the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) comes to provide immunisation and other services in the village, ASHA will promote a\\ue001 endance by those who need the Anganwadi or ANM services and helps with service delivery. 3. Visits to the health facility: This is usually accompanying a pregnant woman or some other neighbour who requests her services for escort. The visit could also be to a\\ue001 end a training programme or review meeting. In some months, there would be only one visit, in others, there would be more.4. Holding village level meeting of women’s groups, and the Village Health and Sanitation Commi\\ue001 ee (VHSC), for increasing health awareness and to plan health work.5. Maintain records which would make her more organised and make her work easier, and help her to plan be\\ue001 er for the health of the people.The \\ue054 rst three relate to facilitation or provision of healthcare and the last two are supportive and mobilisational activities. \\nPart ABeing an ASHA\\n9\\n3. Measurable Outcomes of the ASHA ProgrammeIn the course of conducting these \\ue054 ve activities, the ASHA should ensure the following: Maternal Health 1. That every pregnant woman and her family receive health information for promotion of appropriate healthcare practices – diet, rest and for increased use of services which would focus on care in pregnancy, delivery, postnatal care and family planning services. 2. That every pregnant woman avails of antenatal care and postnatal care at the monthly health worker clinic/VHND.3. That every family with a pregnant woman has made a plan and is prepared for the event of childbirth. 4. That every couple that needs contraceptive services is counselled on where to avail of the service. Newborn and Child Health 1. That every newborn is visited as per the schedule, more o\\ue002 en if there are problems and receives essential home-based care as well as appropriate referral for the sick newborn.2. That every family receives the information and support it needs to access immunisation.3. That all families with children below the age of two years are counselled and supported for – prevention and management of malnutrition and anaemia and for prevention of illness such as malaria, recurrent diarrhoea and respiratory infection. 4. That every child below \\ue054 ve years with diarrhoea, fever, Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) and worms, brought to her a\\ue001 ention is counselled on whether referral is immediately required or whether, given the problems of access to a doctor, \\ue054 rst contact curative care with home remedies and drugs in her kit, the child can be managed.Disease Control1. That those individuals noticed during home visits as having chronic cough or blindness or a skin patch in a high leprosy block are referred to the appropriate centre for further check-up. 2. That those prescribed a long course of drugs for tuberculosis or leprosy or surgery for cataract are followed up and encouraged to take the drugs or go for surgery.3. That those with fever which could be malaria (or kala – azar) have their blood tested to detect the disease and provide appropriate care/referral.4. That the village and health authorities are alerted to any outbreak of disease she notes during her visits. Note: Each outcome is not a separate activity. They are part of the protocol followed during a single activity _ the home visit.ASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n10\\n4. Essential Skills for an ASHAThe essential skills that an ASHA requires can be classi\\ue054 ed into six sets. These are simple skills requiring only a few hours to learn, but they can save thousands of lives. These six sets of skills are given below:1. Maternal Carea. Counselling of pregnant womenb. Ensuring complete antenatal care through home visits and enabling care at VHNDc. Making the birth plan and support for safe delivery d. Undertaking post-partum visits, Counselling for family planning.\\n2. Newborn Care when visiting the newborn at home:a. Counselling and problem solving on breastfeedingb. Keeping the baby warmc. Identification and basic management of LBW (Low Birth Weight) and pre-term babyd. Examinations needed for identification/first contract care for sepsis and asphyxia\\n3. Child Care  a. Providing home care for diarrhoea, Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI), fever and appropriate referral, when requiredb. Counselling for feeding during illnessc. Temperature managementd. De-worming and treatment of iron deficiency anaemia, with referral where requirede. Counselling to prevent recurrent illness especially diarrhoea.Part ABeing an ASHA\\n11\\n6. Social Mobilisationa. Conducting women’s group meetings and VHSC meetingsb. Assisting in making village health plansc. Enabling marginalised and vulnerable communities to be able to access health services.\\n4. Nutritiona. Counselling and support for exclusive breastfeedingb. Counselling mothers on complementary feedingc. Counselling and referral of malnourished children.\\n5. Infectionsa. Identifying persons whose symptoms are suggestive of malaria, leprosy, tuberculosis, etc. during home visits, community level care and referral b. Encouraging those who are put on treatment to take their drugs regularlyc. Encouraging the village community to take collective action to prevent spread of these infections and individuals to protect themselves from getting infected.In addition, there are important skills related to self-awareness, communication, and organising a meeting which have been already taught in Module 5.ASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n12\\nFor an ASHA to be e\\ue000 ective in improving people’s access to health services and their health status, an ASHA should:• Have the knowledge and skills to explain the basic maternal and child health services, educate on preventive and promotive aspects of maternal and child health, and provide some measure of immediate relief and advice if there is any illness.• Have the knowledge and skills on other general health issues, especially related to common infections, and be able to provide information on access to services and preventive and promotive aspects of healthcare.• Be friendly and polite with people and known among community, and establish rapport with the family during household visits.• Be a special friend to the needy, the marginalised, and the less powerful.• Possess the art of listening.• Have the skill of coordination with Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI), AWW and ANM.• Be competent in conducting meetings in the community.• Be motivated and feel happy and rewarded to help community/serve people.• Have a positive a\\ue001 itude and be keen to learn new skills.\\n5. Qualities that Make an ASHA Effective\\nPart ABeing an ASHA\\n13\\n6. Conducting a Home Visit  The purpose of the home visit is to interact with the family, especially the young women of the house, so as to develop a rapport with them, communicate key health messages, support them for be\\ue001 er healthcare practices, identify illness early and provide appropriate advice. In particular, homes with a pregnant woman, or a woman who had an abortion or delivery within the last one month, or with any child below two or any malnourished child needs regular home visits. The \\ue042 rst step is to gather information to understand the situation. You should ask appropriate initial questions, listen to the woman’s response actively, and do not interrupt the woman while she is speaking. Once the mother has \\ue054 nished, ask further questions to clarify what she has said. Then seek more information by asking more detailed and probing questions about the duration of illness and the symptoms.The second step a\\ue002 er listening is to \\ue054 rst praise the mother for how she is managing and reinforce the correct actions she is taking. Then make suggestions to the mother/woman on what further she needs to do – in short sentences and in clear blocks of information. Repeat the key information to make sure that the mother has understood it. You should ask whether the All Visits(Basic communication skills to create friendly environment)• Greeting.• Explain why she is visiting today.• Act in a way so family feels they can confide in her.• Speak in a gentle tone.• Use simple words in local language.• Be respectful.• Praise what the woman is doing correctly and build up her self-confidence.• Point out why you are discouraging some health practices; do not merely condemn it or brand it as bad, superstition etc. • Ask, don’t tell. • Check if the woman has any questions.• Answer in simple language.• Thank the woman after the visit and inform the family when you (ASHA) will return.\\nASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n14\\nsuggestion is applicable and acceptable, and whether she would be able to implement it. If necessary, ask the woman to repeat what has been suggested. Discuss further and come to an understanding of what can be done Then the third step, you should discuss and try to correct any misconceptions or rumours. Finally, you should also arrange for follow-up visit or referral. Do NOT “prescribe” health advice: You need to “counsel.” See the examples below: Gratuitous Ineffective Messages Useful Health Communication MessageTo prevent diarrhoea, pay attention to cleanliness. \\nTo prevent diarrhoea, please ensure that you wash your hands with soap and water before preparing food or feeding the child and after cleaning up after defecation.Take good care of the child. Are you able to find enough time to feed the child? To play with the child? Who looks after the child when you are at work?Your child is now one year old. You must give it nutritious food. \\nWould it be possible for you to give your child an egg daily (or milk, green vegetables etc)? How would you manage it? Can you afford it? Would other children in the family also demand it, and would that create a problem?Difficult SituationsIf the woman is shy• Speak of general things to ‘warm her up’.• Encourage the woman to speak.• Praise the woman more to make her confident.• Repeat the questions.If the woman is non-cooperative or argumentative • Praise the women to make her feel secure.• Sympathise with her and be friendly; do not get angry.• Spend more time in listening to her. • Do not push if the woman is still not immediately receptive but just say that you would like to come again. If the woman is curious and asks many questions• Answer her questions in simple language.• Explain that you will be coming every month so they can talk again.\\nPart ABeing an ASHA\\n15\\n7. Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND) VHND is a common platform for allowing the people to access the services of the ANM and the male health worker and of the Anganwadi Centre (AWC). It is held at the AWC once every month. The ANM gives immunisation to the children, provides antenatal care to pregnant women and provides counselling and contraceptive services to eligible couples. In addition, the ANM provides a basic level of curative care for minor illness with referral where needed. The VHND is an occasion for health communication on a number of key health issues. It should be a\\ue001 ended by the members of the PRI, particularly the women members, pregnant women, women with children under two, adolescent girls and general community members. The VHND is to be seen as a major mobilisation event to reinforce health messages. You should provide information on the topics given below during the VHND. These topics can be taken up one by one and completed over a period of one year. Topics for Health Communication during the VHND • Care in pregnancy, including nutrition, importance of antenatal care and danger sign recognition. • Planning for safe deliveries and postnatal care.• Exclusive breastfeeding and the importance of appropriate complementary feeding.• Immunisation: the schedule and the importance of adhering to it.• Importance of safe drinking water, hygiene and sanitation, and discussion on what actions can be taken locally to improve the situation. • Delaying the age at marriage, postponing the \\ue054 rst pregnancy and the need for spacing.• Adolescent health awareness, including nutrition, retention in school till high/higher secondary level, anaemia correction, menstrual hygiene and responsible sexual behaviour. • Prevention of Malaria, TB and other communicable diseases.• Awareness on prevention and seeking care for RTI/STI and HIV/AIDS.• Prevention of tobacco use and alcoholism.What should you do for a successful VHND?• Make a list of the following and ensure their presence during the VHND meeting:\\ue000  Pregnant women for their antenatal or postnatal care. \\nASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n16\\n\\ue000  Women who need to come for ANC for \\ue054 rst time or for repeat visit.\\ue000  Infants who need their next dose of immunisation.\\ue000  Malnourished children.\\ue000  TB patients who are on anti-TB drugs.\\ue000  Those with fever who have not been able to see a doctor. \\ue000  Eligible couples who need contraceptive services or counselling.\\ue000  Any others who want to meet the ANM.• Specially identifying families who are new migrants, living in hamlets or are vulnerable because of poverty or otherwise marginalised and ensuring their a\\ue001 endance.• Coordinate with the AWW and the ANM to know in advance which day the VHND is scheduled so as to inform those who need these services and the community, especially the VHSC members. • Undertake a part of the health communication work done at the VHND. Part ABeing an ASHA\\n17\\nc. Drug Kit Stock Register\\nb. ASHA Diary\\n8. What Records do the ASHA MaintainA village health register that:a.  Village Health Registera. Village Health Register in which you will record details of pregnant women, children, 0-5 years, eligible couples and others in need of services.b. An ASHA diary which is a record of your work and also useful for tracking performance based payments due to you.c. Maintaining drug kit stocks: You are provided with a drug kit so as to be able to treat minor ailments/problems. The drug kit contains: Paracetomol tablets, Albendazole tablets, Iron Folic Acid (IFA) tablets, Chloroquine tablets, Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS), and eye ointment. In addition, the kit may contain condoms and oral contraceptive pills, pregnancy testing kits, and malaria testing kits. The contents of the kit may change depending on the needs of the state.  The drug kit is to be re-\\ue054 lled on a regular basis from the nearest PHC. To keep a record of consumption of the drugs, and for e\\ue000 ective re-\\ue054 lling and ensuring adequate/timely availability, a drug kit stock card is maintained. This can be completed by the person who re\\ue054 lls the kit or by you.  (Annexe 1: Sample drug kit stock card)ASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n18\\n9. ASHA Support and Supervision • For ASHA to be e\\ue000 ective and for her skills to be updated, she needs both on-the-job support and refresher trainings. • Each ASHA will be supported in the \\ue054 eld by an ASHA facilitator.• The ASHA facilitator will interact with ASHA at least twice if not thrice a month. • At least one of these interactions will be in the form of a “mentoring” visit to the hamlet where she provides her services. This would focus on mentoring or on-the-job training. \\n• Another one or two interactions would be in a local review meeting. This could be held at Gram Panchayat (GP) level, or at the sector level or even at the block level. • Each of the facilitators will have a clear protocol of activities to follow for the mentoring visit to the ASHAs and for the review meetings. The purpose of these interactions are:a Collecting health related information as observed by ASHA and information on what work ASHA is doing.b For providing support to the ASHA to manage the health problems they encounter.c For providing training and refresh or update their knowledge and skills.d For helping ASHAs plan their work.e For building up mutual solidarity and motivation.f For troubleshooting problems, especially as regards payments and addressing grievances. g For re\\ue054 lls to their drug kit• The Medical O\\ue003  cer In-charge of the block PHC/CHC should a\\ue001 end at least one monthly meeting of all ASHAs in the Primary Health Centre (PHC) area, to review work progress.PART BMaternalHealth21 Maternal HealthPart B\\nMaternal Health1. Pregnancy Diagnosis Diagnosis of pregnancy should be done as early as possible a\\ue002 er the \\ue054 rst missed period. There are two ways to diagnose pregnancy early:• Missed Periods• Pregnancy testing: through use of the Nischay home pregnancy test card \\ue000 The Nischay test card can be used easily by you to test if a woman is pregnant. \\ue000 The test can be done immediately a\\ue002 er the missed period. \\ue000 A positive test means that the woman is pregnant. \\ue000 The bene\\ue054 t of early diagnosis of pregnancy is that the woman can be registered early by the ANM and start ge\\ue001 ing antenatal care soon. \\ue000 A negative test means that the woman is not pregnant. In case she is not pregnant and does not want to get pregnant, you should counsel her to adopt a family planning method.\\ue000 The result of the test should be kept con\\ue054 dential.Instructions for the use of the Nishcay Kit are in Annexe 2.\\nPART B 1All knowledge areas in this chapter have been covered in ASHA Module 2.\\nObjectives of this sessionBy the end of the session the ASHA will learn about:• Diagnosing pregnancy using Nischay Kit.• Determining Last Menstrual Period (LMP) and Expected Date of Delivery (EDD).• Key components of antenatal check-up1. • Identi\\ue054 cation of problems and danger signs during the antenatal period and appropriate referral.• Provide appropriate care for anaemia.• Developing plans for birth preparedness. • Follow-up with pregnant women. • Knowledge of safe delivery. • Understand obstetric emergencies and enable appropriate referral for emergencies.• Updating Maternal Health Cards with support from the ANM.\\nASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n22\\n Determining LMP and EDDWhen pregnancy is diagnosed, you should help the pregnant woman in calculating the probable date when she is likely to deliver. Steps to \\ue054 nd the EDD• Find out from the woman the date of the \\ue054 rst day of her LMP .• Then count nine months a\\ue002 er that date.• Add seven days to that date.For example, If the \\ue054 rst day of the LMP is:  10th Dec. 2009Nine months later is: 10th Sept. 2010Adding seven days is: 17th Sept. 2010Therefore, the expected date of delivery is  17th September 2010Note: This method only gives an approximate date of delivery, and baby may be born anytime during 15 days before or after the EDD. This picture drawn beside helps you in estimating the date of delivery.\\n117\\n15\\n2345679\\n8101112131416 18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31  1    2     3     4     5    6    7   8   9   10  11  12  1     2    3     4     5    6     7     8   9  10   11 122010 2011\\nThe Measuring Strip to Determine Change in Year\\nThe Circle Aid for Determining Last Menstrual Period (LMP) and Expected Date of Delivery (EDD)\\nJanuary\\nFebruary\\nMarch\\nApril\\nMay\\nJune\\nJuly\\nAugust\\nSeptember\\nOctober\\nNovember\\nDecember\\nJanuary\\nFebruary\\nMarch\\nApril\\nMay\\nJune\\nJuly\\nAugust\\nSeptember\\nOctober\\nNov ember\\nDecember23 Maternal HealthPart B\\nFacts about Antenatal Check-upHow many antenatal check-ups?Four antenatal visits must be ensured, including registration within the first three month period. The suggested schedule is as below: 1st visit:  Within 12 weeks—preferably as soon as pregnancy is suspected—for registration of pregnancy and first antenatal check-up 2nd visit:  Between 14 and 26 weeks3rd visit:  Between 28 and 34 weeks 4th visit: After 36 weeksIt is advisable for the pregnant woman to visit the Medical Officer (MO) at the PHC for the third antenatal visit, as well as availing of the required investigations at the PHC.• Early registration• Regular weight check• Blood test for anaemia • Urine test for protein and sugar• Measure blood pressure• One tablet of IFA every day for three months to prevent anaemia • Treatment for anaemia • Two doses of Tetanus Toxoid (TT) vaccine • Nutrition counselling• Preparing for birth.\\n 2 The components of ANC have already been covered in Module 2.\\nEssential components2 of antenatal careASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n24\\nWhere are ANC services provided? The nearest place for ANC services for a woman is at the AWC during the monthly VHND. The pregnant woman could also go to the Sub-Centre, where the ANM will provide ANC services. ANC services are also provided at the PHC or Community Health Centre (CHC) or district hospital.  Identification of problems and danger signsGiven below are complications that can occur during the antenatal period for which pregnant w omen must seek treatment in an institution:• Jaundice, high blood pressure, fever with chills, or bleeding• Severe anaemia• Women with protein and sugar in their urine• Swelling of feet, face and hands.Given below are danger signs for which pregnant women must seek delivery in a centre where they can manage complications including those requiring surgery and blood transfusion.• Mothers who had a complication in a previous pregnancy (C section, prolonged labour, stillborn, neonatal death)• Pregnant women with severe anaemia.• Pregnant women having any of the danger signs of the antenatal period which are still persisting at the time of delivery.Some women are to be considered more at risk of developing complications during delivery and therefore, must opt for an institutional delivery. These include: • Young mothers (below 19 years of age)• Mothers who are over 40 years of age• Mothers who already have three children• Mothers who have excessive weight gain or do not gain enough weight.Key tasks to be undertaken during ANC• List all pregnant women: Ensure that you cover the women in the poorest families, and in any sections which tend to get le\\ue002  out, e.g. women from SC/ST communities, women living in hamlets far from the main village, or in hamlets that fall between villages and newly migrant women. • Educate pregnant women about care in pregnancy, especially on the importance of increased nutrition, rest, and complete ANC services.\\n25 Maternal HealthPart B\\n• Emphasise the importance of a balanced and nutritious diet during pregnancy. The diet of the pregnant woman should contain a mix of cereals, pulses (including beans and nuts), vegetables including greens, milk, eggs, meat and \\ue054 sh. If possible, the family should be encouraged to add oils, jaggery and fruits to the diet. Meat and nuts are especially good for anaemic women. You should explain to the mother and family that nofoods should be forbidden during pregnancy. • See when ANC is due for each check-up and remind them appropriately.• Escort pregnant woman to VHND where they are hesitant or need such support.• Ensure that all components of ANC are delivered.• Ensure that the Maternal Card is updated.Planning for a Safe DeliveryYou should• Know how to calculate the EDD and communicate this to the pregnant woman.• Know which institutions in the area provide different levels of care and establish linkages with providers there. • At least once before delivery, take the pregnant woman to this centre and introduce her to the providers.• Know what transport is available _ whether funded by the state or other private means _ that is easily accessible and affordable and how to call on it when the need arises.• Assist all pregnant women and families to prepare plans for birth: including identifying funding sources should money be required at short notice. Sometimes Self-Help Groups (SHGs) may advance money in emergency even if the woman is not a member. This is most important for women in remote hamlets, or in communities which are currently not availing of institutional delivery or those at high risk for complications. • Know what records (BPL card) need to be carried to the institution.• Share birth plans with ANM and PHC MO at the VHND or monthly meeting.• Identify mothers with complications, or a high likelihood of developing complications with support from the ANM. Inform them of the institutions that it is most advisable for them to go to and motivate the mother and the family to go there and escort them if required. ASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n26\\n2. Birth Preparedness for a Safe DeliveryWhat is Birth Preparedness? This is a method of planning in advance by the pregnant mother and her family for a safe and comfortable delivery and for care a\\ue002 er delivery. You should help every family make this plan in consultation with the ANM.What are the choices available to the mother? 1. If there are any danger signs or complications: Identify the nearest institution (CHC/District Hospital) which has the sta\\ue000  and equipment to provide Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (CEmONC), and counsel the mother and the family to go there. \\n2. If there are no complications: Counsel the mother to go to the PHC which is open 24 X 7, where there is a team of doctors and nurses or ANMs to conduct the delivery and provide care for the mother and newborn. These institutions can manage some complications and transfer immediately to a higher facility if complications requiring surgery or blood transfusion develop. The list of such institutions can be obtained from the ANM. The place should be clean and safe and friendly and have a skilled nurse or doctor at all times. The woman would have to stay there for 48 hours a\\ue002 er delivery . 3. If there are no complications and mother and her family are reluctant or unable to go to the 24x7 PHC or if it is too far away: Advise the mother could go the Sub-Centre, provided it is accredited as a delivery centre, which means the ANM has been trained as a Skilled Birth A\\ue001 endant (SBA), and is available, and there are minimum facilities for delivery.4. If there are no complications or not a high risk case for developing complications and the mother and family insist on delivering at home, despite counselling: You could work with the ANM to enable a delivery by SBA. This should be agreed to only if you are sure that the family can organise transport and funds at very short notice. The SBA should be able to arrive within 30 minutes of the onset of labour at the home/Sub-Centre and should able to stay through the process of labour and for a few hours a\\ue002 erwards. A team of two or three women with experience in a\\ue001 ending at labour would be helpful.What does a birth preparedness plan contain? (See Annexe-3 for format for individual plan)When should a birth preparedness plan be readied? It should be ready as early as possible a\\ue002 er con\\ue054 rming the pregnancy, and in consultation with the family (husband, mother-in-law, or other decision makers). You should review the plan in the third trimester (a\\ue002 er seventh month) with the family and the ANM. At this time, the choice of institution and the transport should be \\ue054 nalised. 27 Maternal HealthPart B\\nDecisions People Make\\n Where should I go for a safe delivery?\\nBirth Micro Plan of ASHA/ANM/AWW\\nI help every family with a pregnant woman to make a birth plan. \\nIf she has any danger signs or complications, I will ask her to go to the CHC or DH when her delivery is due.I must also make arrangements to ensure that the transport is ready and available at that time. \\nBut if she and her family do not want to go that far and the 24X7 PHC is crowded, I will advise her to go to the nearby sub-centre where two ANMs are trained to conduct deliveries and one of them is always there.For some women, family circumstances and beliefs make even going to the sub-centre dif\\ue000 cult. I will then get the ANM to come to her house, and will assist in the preparations needed, after counselling that a safe delivery in this situation may not always be possible. \\nIf I go to the PHC which is open 24 hours, I will be cared for and can rest for two days.

Management of AnaemiaIn India, anaemia among women is very common. The chances of a mother having a delivery before term, or even dying are higher among mothers with severe anaemia. In order to make sure that all women have good iron stores, all pregnant women should be given iron tablets, even if they are not anaemic. Anaemia can be detected by a simple blood test, which measures the amount of a pigment called Haemoglobin (Hb). Low levels of Hb mean that the woman has anaemia (see box below). The test should be performed during the antenatal check-up. This can be done at the VHND by the ANM. Haemoglobin level Degree of anaemiaMore than 11 g/dl Absence of anaemia/Normal7-11 g/dl Moderate anaemiaLess than 7 g/dl Severe anaemiaIf a woman during the time of pregnancy has Hb level below 11g/dl, she is considered to be su\\ue000 ering from anaemia. Common symptoms of severe anaemia include:• Very pale tongue• Weakness• General swelling in body. For women who do not have anaemia (Hb more than 11 g/dl)The pregnant woman should take one tablet of IFA every day for at least 100 days (prophylactic dose), starting a\\ue002 er the \\ue054 rst trimester, at least 14-16 weeks of gestation to prevent anaemia. This dosage regimen is to be repeated again for three months a\\ue002 er the delivery.If a woman is found to be anaemic:• The woman should be given two IFA tablets per day for three months. This means that a pregnant w oman with anaemia needs to take at least 200 tablets of IFA. Besides taking IFA tablets, you should encourage the pregnant woman, where possible, to increase her dietary intake of iron-rich food.• The Hb level should be estimated again a\\ue002 er one month. If the level increases, you should tell the woman to continue with two tablets of IFA daily until the Hb comes to normal. If the Hb does not rise in spite of taking IFA tablets, in the prescribed dose, you should refer the woman to the nearest facility that is equipped to manage complications in pregnancy.• You should refer women with severe anaemia immediately to the nearest PHC/CHC/DH for further treatment. Such women may need injections or blood transfusions. \\n29 Maternal HealthPart B\\n• The dosage regimen of two IFA tablets per day should be repeated for three months post-partum also. Counselling pregnant women on anaemia:•  Encourage women to take iron-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, whole pulses, ragi, jaggery, meat and liver. This advice should be discussed with family and \\ue054 nalised based on the family situation. •  Encourage the woman, where possible, to take plenty of fruits and vegetables containing vitamin C (such as mango, guava, orange and sweet lime) as these enhance the absorption of iron.•  Counsel the women on the necessity of taking IFA, the dangers associated with anaemia, and inform the women that these side-e\\ue000 ects are common and not serious, and will reduce over time.•  IFA tablets must be taken regularly, preferably early in the morning on an empty stomach. If the woman has nausea and pain in abdomen, she may take the tablets a\\ue002 er meals or at night. This will avoid nausea.• Dispel the myths and misconceptions related to IFA and convince the woman about the importance of taking it. An example of a common myth is that the consumption of IFA may a\\ue000 ect baby’s complexion.• Many women do not take IFA tablets regularly due to some common side-e\\ue000 ects such as nausea, constipation and black stools. Tell women not to worry about passing black stool while consuming IFA. It is normal. • In case of constipation, the woman should drink more water and add roughage (plenty of green leafy vegetables) to her diet.• IFA tablets should not be consumed with tea, co\\ue000 ee, milk or calcium tablet as it reduces the absorption of iron.• IFA tablets may make the woman feel less tired than before. However, despite feeling be\\ue001 er, she should not stop taking the tablets and must complete the course as advised by the healthcare provider.• Ask the woman to return to you if she has problem taking IFA tablets. How do you get the IFA?The IFA tablets are part of your drug kit. Try to ensure that you always have enough stock. Either your facilitator or a person appointed by the MO of the PHC is given the responsibility of re\\ue054lls for the drug kit. IFA tablets are alsomade available at VHND or in any health facility.\\nASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n30\\n4.

Care during DeliveryObservation of the delivery process was not part of previous ASHA training modules. In this module, you will be oriented to normal delivery processes and newborn care, and also develop the skills for recording the various events and pregnancy outcome. Even though you are not required to manage delivery, you may have to help if the delivery starts during transport. This knowledge also gives you con\\ue054 dence to know more about this. You should try and stay with the pregnant woman through delivery in the institution or at home, and post-partum period. You could therefore also be a ‘Birth Companion’ to the mother during the stay at the institution. This is not a compulsion, but a desirable service. Alternatively, a close relative could also be the birth companion.35 Maternal HealthPart B\\nBefore DeliveryThe delivery room should be cleaned before the delivery. If the delivery is happening at home, you should facilitate a clean delivery space. Immediately after birth, if the baby remains naked, it may become cold. Hence, baby clothes should be kept ready before delivery. 1st Stage of labourStarts from the beginning of pain until the mouth of the womb is fully open. This happens inside and cannot be seen. The bag of water also breaks at the end of this stage. The fluid is usually clear but may be yellow or green or red. If green, it indicates infection.This first stage of labour usually lasts about 8 to 12 hours in the first pregnancy. May take much less time in subsequent pregnancies.\\nIllustration (a) - drawing of side view of a pregnant woman.In illustration (b) - the mouth of the womb is almost closed, and thick.In illustration (c) - the mouth is thinner and is opening little.In (d) - the mouth of the womb is fully open. When the womb is completely open, it is the end of the first stage of labour. At this time, the water bag usually breaks. This first stage of labour usually lasts about 8 to 12 hours.

Such injections can cause a baby who is still born, birth of a baby who is unable to breathe, or even cause the death of the newborn. However, the same injections are advisable after the baby has been born in order to control bleeding after delivery. Only the ANM or doctor should give the injection. • When the mother and baby stay in the hospital and if you are staying with them as a birth companion, she should ensure that the mother and baby are seen by the MO and nurse at least twice a day and whenever required if there are problems. \\nThe very top of the head comes \\ue054 rst, then the eyes, nose and mouth (d). While in most babies, the eyes are facing the \\ue055 oor; sometimes they are born looking towards the ceiling. When the baby’s head is out, it turns to one side (e) and the shoulders and rest of the body are delivered (f). Once out, the baby will cry. Delivery of Placenta The cord will be connected to the placenta which is still inside the womb.ASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n38\\n6. Post-Partum Care Post-partum care is the period a\\ue002 er delivery of the placenta up to six weeks a\\ue002 er birth.3  3  Post-partum care has been covered in ASHA Module 2.\\nTasks for you to undertake during this period• Conducting home visits to mother and child: Mothers and newborns need care from the time of birth to six weeks a\\ue002 er the delivery. The recommendation for postnatal care is to visit on the 3rd day a\\ue002 er delivery, on the 7th day and at the end of six weeks, i.e on the 42nd day. For the newborn, the recommendation is to visit on the 3rd day, 7th day, 14th day, 21st day and 28th day. A\\ue002 er this period, visits are still needed once in two weeks till the child is two years old for nutrition advice, immunisation advice, and support for breastfeeding and complementary feeding, for illness prevention and just to remain in touch. • In e\\ue000 ect therefore, you would need to visit on the 3rd, 7th, 14th day, 21st, and 28th day, and a\\ue002 er that, once every two weeks starting from the 42nd day, till the child is two years old. If the child is born at home, then of course you should be there at birth or at least visit her within the \\ue054 rst hour. • Advice to the mother during these visits: \\ue000 Assess the mother for signs of complications (see below for the list of complications) and ensure appropriate referral.\\ue000 Encourage her to rest for at least six weeks a\\ue002 er childbirth. Families should be counselled to allow this. \\ue000 Encourage her to eat more food than usual. She can eat any kind of food but high protein foods – pulses and legumes (nuts are especially useful), foods of animal source. She should also drink plenty of \\ue055 uids. \\nObjectives of the sessionBy the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about: • Schedule of visits and tasks to be performed at each visit.• Understand the possible complications of the post-partum period.• Be able to identify the complications and refer appropriately.39 Maternal HealthPart B\\n\\ue000 Encourage and support for exclusive breastfeeding (Please see section on Breastfeeding-Part C, Section 3)\\ue000 Discuss with the mother the need for contraceptive services. Caution her on the risk of unprotected sex and the high chances of conceiving again. You should counsel her on the importance of spacing the next child birth for her own health and that of the baby. You should help her in making the choice of the method of family planning, whether spacing or limiting. Complications during the post-partum periodSome women can develop complications a\\ue002 er the childbirth. The symptoms of these major complications are:1. Excessive bleeding: Ask the mother if the bleeding is heavy. O\\ue002 en this is quite obvious, but sometimes it may be di\\ue003  cult to judge. If the woman is using more than \\ue054 ve pads a day or more than one thick cloth in a day, she is having heavy bleeding. You should immediately refer her to an institution which manages complications. You should also ask the mother to begin breastfeeding immediately, that should help reduce the bleeding. Referral is most urgent. Even the delay of a few minutes can make a di\\ue000 erence. 2. Puerperal Sepsis (Infections): Ask if the discharge is foul smelling. If the answer is yes, then suspect infection. Fever, chills and pain in abdomen along with the foul smell make infections even more likely. You should measure temperature to con\\ue054 rm fever. Referral is required since the mother needs antibiotics. Referral on the same day is advisable. 3. Convulsions with or without swelling of face and hands, severe headache, and blurred vision: Such patients need immediate referral. If ANM is available within 15 minutes, she can stabilise the patient before referral.4. Anaemia: You should check if the mother is pale and enable the mother to get her blood Hb status checked (for management of anaemia in the post-partum period, please see Section 3).5. Breast engorgement and Infection: (Part C: Newborn Health)\\nASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n40\\n6. Perineal Swelling and Infection: If the mother has a small tear at the opening of her vagina (or has had stitches during the delivery), she should keep the area clean. She can apply cloth dipped in hot water, twice a day and hold it to her genitals. This will give her relief and help the healing. If there is fever, she should be referred to the PHC or CHC. A tablet of paracetomol would help both the pain and the fever. 7. Post-Partum Mood Changes: Some women may su\\ue000 er from mood changes a\\ue002 er delivery. They need counselling and family support. The changes usually disappear a\\ue002 er a week or so. If the changes become severe then referral is required. \\nPart CNewborn Health 41\\nPART CNewbornHealthPart CNewborn Health\\n43\\nNewborn Health\\nPART CObjectives of the sessionBy the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about: • Observe and assist during the immediate newborn period in case she is present at the time of delivery.• Observe the baby during the \\ue054 rst hour, during the \\ue054 rst two days and during the \\ue054 rst month to take care of the newborn, support and help the mother to breastfeed, and to keep the baby warm.• Know what her speci\\ue054 c role is during the home visits, and learn how to care for the newborn. 1. Care of the Baby at the time of DeliveryMany babies die immediately after birth due to asphyxia. In case of home delivery, when mild labour pains start, you can manage asphyxiated babies by removing mucus and can initiate respiration with the help of the instruments you have.You should encourage the mother to start breastfeeding immediately after the delivery, as this will help in quick delivery of placenta and minimises bleeding. Starting to breastfeed immediately after the birth makes the baby stronger.Chances of the baby’s death and getting sick are higher among the babies born before time (pre-term) and in LBW babies, (Weight less than 2500 gm increases the risk and below 1800 gm, the risk is considered very high.)\\nASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n44\\n2. Schedule of Home Visits for the care of the NewbornThe purpose of these visits is to ensure that the newborn is being kept warm and breastfed exclusively. Encourage the mother to breastfeed, discourage harmful practices such as bo\\ue001 le feeds, early baths, giving other substances by mouth, and to identify early signs of sepsis or other illnesses in the newborn. • The newborn requires a visit immediately a\\ue002 er birth (or within the \\ue054 rst 24 hours), and on Day 2, if the baby is born at home. • If the baby is born at a facility, persuade and support the mother to stay for at least 48 hours, and therefore, the \\ue054 rst two visits are taken care of in the institution. However, if you are there with the mother, as a birth companion, then you could be of assistance to the nurse/ANM there.• If the baby is born in a health facility, or at home, you should visit the baby on Days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Additional visits are needed for newborn babies which are LBW, born before term and are sick. 3. Examining the Newborn at BirthSteps for you to take “just after” the baby is born if the baby is born at home, or if you are present at the delivery,1. Ask the mother about/observe the \\ue055 uid a\\ue002 er the waters break.2. If the \\ue055 uid is yellow/green, as soon as the head is seen (even before delivery of complete baby), clean the mouth of the baby with gauze piece.3. As soon as the baby is born, note the time of birth and start counting time.4. Observation of baby at birth or within the \\ue054 rst 30 seconds and at 5 minutes a\\ue002 er birth for movement of limbs, breathing and crying. The \\ue054 gure below will enable the assessment of whether the newborn should be recorded as a live or still birth. All six have to be “No” to declare a still birth. Even if one is “yes” the baby should be declared as live birth. 5. If there is no cry or a weak cry, if there is no breathing or weak breathing or gasping, this condition is called Asphyxia. If the baby is asphyxiated (does not breathe at birth), and there is no doctor or nurse, you should try to help and this skill is taught to you, in Module 7. However, in many such newborns, your e\\ue000 orts may not make enough di\\ue000 erence and you should not feel bad or blame yourself for this.

The so\\ue002  white substance with which the newborn is covered is actually protective and should not be rubbed o\\ue000 . \\ue000  The baby should be kept close to mother’s chest and abdomen.  \\ue000  The baby should be wrapped in several layers of clothing/woollen clothing depending upon the season. \\ue000  The room should be warm enough for an adult to feel just uncomfortable. The room should be free from strong wind.8. You should weigh the newborn and decide whether the baby is normal or LBW. 9. Determine whether the baby is term or pre-term.10. Measure newborn temperature.First examination of newborna. You should conduct the first examination within first 24 hours of delivery and look for the following:• Whether the baby has any abnormality such as curved limbs, jaundice, bump on head, cle\\ue002  lip.• How the baby is suckling at the breast. \\nPart CNewborn Health\\n47\\n• Whether the baby has loose limbs. • Listen to the cry of the baby. • Provide care of eyes. If there is pus/purulent discharge from eyes and no doctor or nurse available, apply tetracycline ointment. Even for normal eyes, tetracycline is used as a preventive, so even in doubt as to whether it is pus, it could be given. • Keep umbilical cord dry and clean. b. General precautions the family must takeThe newborn is delicate and can easily fall sick if the family and mother are not careful. Y ou should explain some general precautions that the family should take. • Bathing the baby: Although it is recommended that the baby should not be bathed until the \\ue054 rst seven days, many families would like to bathe the baby on the \\ue054 rst or second day. For a normal baby, if the family insists, the baby could be bathed a\\ue002 er the second day. But in the case of LBW baby, you must insist on their waiting for at least seven days. You should explain that bathing the baby and leaving it wet or exposed may cause it to get cold and fall sick. Thus, it is be\\ue001 er to wipe the baby with a warm wet cloth and dry the baby immediately.• Keep the baby away from people who are sick.• People who are sick with cold, cough, fever, skin infection, diarrhoea, etc. should not hold the baby or come in close contact with the baby.• The newborn baby should not be taken to places where there are other sick children.• The newborn baby should also not be taken to places where there are large gatherings of people.c. What are you expected to do during the newborn visits?• Enquire and \\ue054 ll the mother’s information on home visit form. (Annexe 6)• Enquire and \\ue054 ll newborn information on home visit form. These forms help you to think about all the steps you need to take. (Annexe 7)• Take out the necessary equipment from the bag and keep on a clean cloth.• Wash your hands well as taught.• Then examine the baby – a. measure temperature, b. weigh the baby, and c. perform other activities in the sequence provided in the newborn home visit form.

Learn how to take care of babies less than 2.5 kgBabies whose weight is in the yellow or red zone are small and require extra care as follows:• Provide extra warmth.• Family should ensure. \\ue000 Baby is wrapped well with thin sheets and blankets. \\ue000 The head is covered to prevent heat loss. \\ue000 The baby is kept very close to the mother’s abdomen and chest. \\ue000  Warm water \\ue054 lled bo\\ue001 les wrapped in cloth may be kept on either side of the baby’s blankets, when not being kept close to the mother’s body. \\ue000 The baby must be fed more frequently. Part CNewborn Health\\n49\\nAll babies below 1.8 kg must be taken to a 24x7 facility or other facility known to provide referral care for sick newborn and examined by a doctor or nurse.h. Umbilical cord care• Cord should be kept clamped, till it dries and falls o\\ue000 .  • No application of any medicine is required if there is no bleeding or discharge.• The umbilical cord should be kept clean and dry at all times.i. Eye careSkill checklist for applying eye ointment If a newborn has pus discharging from its ey es you can put antibiotic ointment in the baby’s eyes or a capsule which is available in the market. How to put antibiotic ointment:• Gently pull the baby’s lower eyelid down.• Squeeze a thin line of ointment moving from the inside corner to the outside of the eye.• Do not touch the baby’s eye with the tip of the tube. If the tube touches the babies eyes, it shouldn’t be used again.• If the eyes are swollen with pus, then put the ointment two times a day for 5 days.\\nRemember: The usual bathroom scales cannot reliably record small di\\ue000 erences in weights. That is why bathroom scales cannot accurately record newborn weight and it is not advisable to use these for weighing newborns.ASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n50\\n4. Breastfeedinga. Benefits for the baby• Early skin-to-skin contact keeps the baby warm.• It helps in early secretion of breast milk.• Feeding \\ue054 rst milk (colostrum) protects the baby from diseases.• Helps mother and baby to develop a close and loving relationship.b. Benefits for the mother• Helps womb to contract and the placenta is expelled easily.• Reduce the risk of excessive bleeding a\\ue002 er delivery.c. Important facts about breastfeeding• Start breastfeeding immediately or at least within one hour a\\ue002 er birth. Give nothing else, not even water.• Baby should be put to the mother’s breast even before placenta is delivered. It is useful for both the baby as well as the mother.• Breastfeed as o\\ue002 en as the baby wants and for as long as the baby wants. Baby should be breastfed day and night at least 8-10 times in 24 hours.• Feeding more o\\ue002 en helps in production of more milk. The more the baby sucks, more milk is produced.• Baby should not be given any other liquid or foods such as sugar water, honey, ghu\\ue001 i, goat’s/cow’s milk and not even water.\\nObjectives of the session By the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about: • Counsel mother for breastfeeding.• Provide breastfeeding support. • Emphasise importance of early and exclusive breastfeeding.• Help mother to express milk and feed babies who cannot suckle at birth.• Manage breastfeeding problems (engorgement, cracked nipple, mother feels she does not have enough milk).\\nPart CNewborn Health\\n51\\nd.

Correct position for breastfeedingTo obtain maximum bene\\ue054 t of breastfeeding, the baby should be held in the correct position and be put correctly to the breast. The baby is in the correct position when:• While holding the baby, the mother also supports the baby’s bo\\ue001 om, and not just the head or shoulders.• Mother holds the baby close to her body.• The baby’s face is facing the breast, with nose opposite the nippleBreastfeeding PositionsCradle Position Side-lying PositionUnderarm Position Alternate Underarm Position\\nASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n52\\nf. Counselling tips• You are there to help the mother, not to take over.• Use verbal and non-verbal skills to make her feel at ease.• Encourage and praise her; every mother has the ability to breastfeed. O\\ue002 en mothers are worried that they are inexperienced and lack the con\\ue054 dence. Many women do not breastfeed successfully because they do not get good advice, support and encouragement.\\n• If she says something that you do not agree with, do not say ‘that is wrong’. Do not make her feel bad or stupid. You can repeat what she says (For example, ‘I hear you saying that you think you don’t have enough milk....’ Ask her why she thinks so. Listen to what she is saying and why). • A\\ue002 er you assess the breastfeeding, you should check the baby’s weight gain. • Give advice in simple and clear language.• Make sure the mother understands what you are saying.• Have her repeat what she will try to do. g. Why only breastfeeding? Giving other food or \\ue055 uid may harm the baby in following ways• It reduces the amount of breast milk taken by the baby.• It may contain germs from water or on feeding bo\\ue001 les or utensils. These germs can cause diarrhoea.• It may be too dilute, so the baby becomes malnourished.• Baby does not get enough iron from cow’s and goat’s milk and may thus develop anaemia.• Baby may develop allergies.• Baby may have di\\ue003  culty digesting animal milk; the milk can cause diarrhoea, rashes or other symptoms. Diarrhoea may become persistent. • Breast milk provides all the water a baby needs. Babies do not need extra water even during the summer months.\\nPart CNewborn Health\\n53\\nManaging Common Breastfeeding ProblemsSore nipples Causes: poor latch-on or positioning at breastManagement• Improve attachment and/or position.• Continue breastfeeding (reduce engorgement if present).• Build mother’s confidence.• Advise her to wash breast once a day; not to use soap for this.•  Put a little breast milk on nipples after feeding is finished (to lubricate the nipple) and air-dry.• Wear loose clothing.•  If nipples are very red, shiny, flaky, itchy, and their condition does not get better with above treatment, it may be fungus infection. Apply gentian violet paint to nipples after each breastfeed for five days. If the condition does not improve, refer to a doctor.Inverted nipplesSometimes the nipple will retract in to the breast, and can be checked even during pregnancy. The best treatment is to encourage the mother to gently pull out the nipple and roll it, several times in a day. Not enough milkCauses: Delayed initiation of breastfeeding; infrequent feeding; giving fluids other than breast milk; mother’s anxiety, exhaustion, insecurity; inadequate family support.Management• Decide whether there is enough milk or not:  \\ue000  Does the baby pass urine six times or more each day?  \\ue000  Has the baby gained sufficient weight? (During the 1st week there is usually a small weight loss, after that a newborn should gain 150-200 gm per week.)  \\ue000  Is the baby satisfied after feeds?• Re-assure mother.• If there is not enough milk, have the baby feed more often.• Check breastfeed to observe mother attachment and positioning of the mother and baby.• Encourage rest. Emphasise the mother to drink and eat more.• Praise her and return for follow-up. \\nASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n54\\nEngorged and painful breasts (very full breasts)Causes: Delayed initiation of breastfeeding, poor attachment, incomplete emptying of breasts, restricting the length of the feeds.Management• Prevent by:  \\ue000 Starting breastfeeding soon after delivery and                feeding often..  \\ue000 Ensuring correct attachment.  \\ue000 Encouraging on-demand feeding.• If baby is able to suckle, feed more frequently, help with positioning.•  If the baby is not able to attach, apply warm compresses to breast, gently massage from outside toward the nipple and express some milk until the areola is soft, then put baby to the breast, making sure that the attachment is correct.•  Have baby feed often to empty out the breasts. If it is not possible, ask the mother to express some milk herself.•  If breasts are red and hard, continue to feed often. Use warm compresses and gently massage breasts towards nipple. Take mother’s temperature. If she has fever, mother should visit the doctor. She should continue to breastfeed (from both sides) even if she is taking antibiotics. Expressing milk by hand1. Wash hands with soap and water.2. Place a warm compress on the breast for a few minutes if desired.3. Gently massage the breast starting from the chest moving toward the nipple; do this in a circle (near the underarm, and then to the bo\\ue001 om of the breast etc.), so that all parts of the breast are massaged.4. Lean forward and support the bo\\ue001 om of the breast with one hand.5. Hold the areola between thumb and two \\ue054 ngers of other hand. Put her hand on the areola above the nipple and the two \\ue054 ngers on the areola below the nipple.6. Press toward the chest (about 1-2 cm) and then squeeze the milk reservoirs beneath the areola (do not squeeze the nipple).7. Press and release the thumb and \\ue054 rst \\ue054 nger several times until the milk drips out. Use a clean bo\\ue001 le or a cup to collect the milk. Milk may drip at the beginning and then spray out a\\ue002 er it starts \\ue055 owing.8. Rotate the thumbs and \\ue054 nger around the areola so that the milk is removed from all the reservoirs.9.

If they get cold, they use up energy, and can become sick. LBW and pre-term babies are at greater risk of ge\\ue001 ing cold.When and why do most newborns get cold?Most newborns lose heat in \\ue054 rst minute a\\ue002 er delivery. They are born wet. If they are le\\ue002  wet and naked, they lose a lot of heat to the air. A newborn baby’s skin is very thin and its head is big in size compared to its body. It loses heat very quickly from its head. Babies do not have the capacity to keep themselves warm. If the newborn baby is not properly dried, wrapped, and its head is not kept covered, it can lose 2 to 4 degree Celsius within 10-20 minutes.Example: If the baby’s temperature was 97.7 degree Fahrenheit (36.5 degree Celsius) (normal temperature) at the time of birth and if there was a loss of 2.7 degree Fahrenheit because the baby was not properly dried and covered, the body temperature will become 95 degree Fahrenheit (35.0 degree Celsius), which is below normal. What is the term for a situation when a baby’s temperature falls below normal?When a baby has a temperature below normal, it su\\ue000 ers from hypothermia. What happens to a baby with hypothermia?A baby who is cold, and has a low temperature (hypothermia) su\\ue000 ers from:• Decreased ability to suckle at the breast, leading to poor feeding and weakness.\\n5. Keeping the Newborn WarmObjectives of the sessionBy the end of this session, the ASHA will learn about: • Identify the newborn whose body temperature is less than normal and whose body temperature is more than normal. • Teach mothers how to keep the newborns warm.• Teach mothers how to re-warm cold babies.• Teach mothers how to control newborn temperature in hot weather.• Learn to take the temperature.\\nASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n58\\n• Increased susceptibility to infections.• Increased risk of death, especially in LBW and pre-term babies.How can you tell if a baby is hypothermic?• The early sign is cold feet.• Then, the body becomes cold.• The best method is to measure the baby’s body temperature.(This skill has already been taught to you)How to keep newborns warm• Before delivery, warm up the room (warm enough for adults).• Immediately a\\ue002 er delivery, dry the baby. • Put a cap on the baby since a lot of heat could be lost though its head.• Place in skin-to-skin contact with mother.• Cover or put clothes on the baby, wrap it up with clean cloth, and place it close to its mother.• Initiate early breastfeeding.• Bathing for newborns:  \\ue000  It is best to wait until the  second day to bathe the baby. One should wait seven days in case of LBW baby.  \\ue000  If the family insists on bathing the \\ue054 rst day, please ask them to delay for at least six hours to give the baby time to adjust with its new environment. \\ue000  For small and pre-term babies, do not give a bath until the baby gains weight (this could be few weeks) and weight of baby become 2,000 gm.• To keep a small baby clean, you can give a light oil massage but making sure that the room is warm and the baby is not le\\ue002  uncovered for more than 10 minutes. DO NOT pour oil into any ori\\ue054 ce, like the nose or ears at any time.• Keep baby loosely clothed and wrapped.• If it is very warm outside, make sure the baby is not too heavily clothed and wrapped; the baby can also get too hot. • Wherever possible, insist on referral to a facility that is managing sick newborns. If this is not immediately possible, begin the following steps:\\nWarming\\nPart CNewborn Health\\n59\\nHow to re-warm a baby getting cold?<97 degree Fahrenheit (36.1 degree Celsius) or too cold <95 degree Fahrenheit (35.0 degree Celsius) • Increase the room temperature.• Remove any wet or cold blankets and clothes.• Hold the baby with its skin next to its mother’s skin (skin-to-skin contact) and place a warmed cloth (not too hot to avoid burns) on its back or chest. As this cloth cools down, replace it with another warmed one, and repeat until the baby is warmer. Continue until the baby’s temperature reaches the normal range.• Put on its clothes and its cap, put it in warm bag, and make it lie close to its mother.• Continue to breastfeed the baby to provide calories and fluids to prevent a drop in the blood glucose level.  \\ue000 A common problem in hypothermic babies.If a baby is too cold <95 degree Fahrenheit (35.0 degree Celsius), follow the above advice, and• Place skin-to-skin, and once the baby is a little warmer, then clothe baby and place in a bed pre-warmed with warm clothes, or a hot stone or hot water bottle. (Remove these articles before putting baby on the bed.)• In an institutional delivery, there should be a newborn corner available with a radiant warmer, or some other suitable heating arrangement where the newborn baby can be kept.\\nASHA Module 6Simple Skills that Save Lives\\n60\\n6. Management of fever in newbornA baby has fever if the temperature is above 99 degree Fahrenheit (37.2 degree Celsius). In the case of high body temperature of the baby during summer, verify in the following manner whether this is due to the body being overdressed or does it really have fever: • Unwrap the baby and take o\\ue000  its cap.• Ventilate the room too to cool the baby. • Ask the mother to start breastfeeding. • If there is a source of extra heat (like a \\ue054 re) in the room, put it out.• Wait for 30 minutes and take the temperature once again. If the baby’s temperature returns to normal, explain to the mother that in very warm weather, the baby does not have to kept covered with additional cloth or kept wrapped. If the temperature is still above normal a\\ue002 er the above measures have been taken, refer the baby for treatment.AnnexesAnnexes\\n63\\nAnnexe 1: ASHA Drug Kit Stock CardMonth & Date of Refill (1) (2) (3) (N)S.No. Name of Drug\\nSymbol*  Balance Refill given\\nBalance Refill given\\nBalance Refill given\\nBalance Refill given12345‘n’Balance: This is what was le\\ue002  in kit at the time of re\\ue054 ll – a\\ue002 er recovering explained drugs/supplies.Re\\ue042 ll: This is what was put into the kit.*Symbol is a pictorial symbol that could be used to denote a drug, since o\\ue002 en, the drugs comes labelled only in English.
